# Galaga Project
Galaga is a classic fixed-shooter arcade game created in 1981. Space Invaders is the precursor to Galaga, created in 1978. This project came to be a type of mashup of the two with enemy movement patterns like those in Space Invaders with images of enemies, the player ship and background of Galaga.

## Game Instructions
Player ship moves left or right only using the left and right arrow keys. To shoot, press the space bar. If player is hit by enemy fire, player loses. If player fails to eliminate all enemies and collides with them, player loses.
